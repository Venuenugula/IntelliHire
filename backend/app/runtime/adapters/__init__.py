"""Anti-corruption adapter layer — the ONLY translation boundary in the v2 runtime.

The runtime, API routes and dependency injection speak *only* the shared contracts
(``app.shared.models`` / ``app.shared.interfaces``). The developers' existing
implementations speak their own shapes. These adapters are the single place where
the two vocabularies meet: every model conversion happens here and nowhere else.

    Shared contracts  <--[ adapters ]-->  legacy implementations

Rules enforced by this package:
  * All model conversions live inside adapters.
  * Runtime stages never convert.
  * API routes never convert.
  * Dependency injection never converts.
  * Shared contracts are untouched.
  * Developer implementations are untouched.

Adapters:
  * EvidenceProviderAdapter — Developer 2 evidence sources -> EvidenceProvider Protocol.
  * CandidateGraphAdapter   — Developer 3 sync GraphBuilder -> GraphBuilder Protocol.
  * NoOpGraphAdapter        — GraphBuilder placeholder / graph-disabled fallback.
  * NoOpFusionEngine        — FusionEngine no-op (fusion done in-builder; required by FusionStage).
  * ReasoningEngineAdapter  — Developer 4 sync ReasoningEngine -> ReasoningEngine Protocol.
  * DecisionEngineAdapter   — Developer 4 sync DecisionEngine -> DecisionEngine Protocol.
